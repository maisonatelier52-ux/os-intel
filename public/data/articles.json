Some steel jobs were temporarily boosted, but farmers needed billions of dollars in bailouts, and the economy as a whole took a small step back. Because the global economy is still recovering from the pandemic and supply chain scars, this time seems bigger. Even though there was a lot of talk about a renaissance, government data shows that manufacturing jobs actually fell by more than 100,000 last year. That makes the story a little less believable for skeptics."

The opposition had to choose former diplomat Edmundo González after they disqualified her on a weak technicality. After that, terrible things happened, like arrests, the end of protests, harassment of candidates, and reliable reports of widespread human rights violations. Things went wrong when the government-run election council declared Maduro the winner, even though there was a lot of proof that he had cheated. For example, opposition-leaked vote totals showed that González won by a landslide. He had to run away to Spain because an arrest warrant was issued for him."

Hospitals are running at barely 40% capacity because of destroyed buildings and empty supply shelves. Eighty-five percent of the population faces food insecurity – many families eat one meal a day, if that. Only 15% of residents have access to clean water. More than 1.5 million displaced people are still without proper shelter. Six hundred and twenty-five thousand children remain out of school. Unemployment has climbed above 75%, leaving entire communities without income."

He is not holding back when he says that Beijing is avoiding responsibility while building up its military."

In October of last year, President Trump said the same thing again: the U.S. might start testing again to keep up with what he called China's \"covert explosions.\" Shen called it \"groundless\" and said that the US was using the accusations as an excuse to start its own program again."

This package was widely seen as one of the most aggressive since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion. The impact is already being felt globally. Some banks in India, which currently takes around 40 percent of all Russian oil supplied to international markets, are reportedly blocking payments for Russian oil imports.

This alert came from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the National Security Agency, and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, who released a detailed advisory together. Brickstorm is a custom-built backdoor that lets attackers slip past defenses, grab sensitive information like passwords and configuration files, and stay hidden inside networks for months at a time. In one confirmed case, the intruders got into a company’s systems back in April 2024 and remained active until September 3, 2025, even though the organization had standard cybersecurity protections in place."

VMware vSphere is one of the most widely used virtualization platforms for managing virtual machines and cloud infrastructure in government, corporate, and defense settings. Once the hackers reach a vCenter server or ESXi host, they can drop Brickstorm, which is often written in Go to make it harder to detect on appliances that don’t run full endpoint protection. The malware changes its own code signature to dodge antivirus scans, uses encrypted channels to talk to its command servers, abuses normal system tools so it doesn’t look suspicious, dumps credentials, and moves sideways across the network. It can even copy itself into startup locations or tweak VMware startup scripts to stay persistent."

Experts say the attackers usually start by compromising something exposed in the DMZ, like a web-facing server, steal credentials from there, and then pivot internally to reach the virtualization management layer. From that point, they can steal virtual machine snapshots to extract more secrets or even create hidden rogue virtual machines that monitoring tools often miss completely."

It's interesting that the group used Google Sheets, which seems like a safe tool, to plan how to get their data out and who to target. They were able to hide their bad behavior for a long time by making it look like normal cloud traffic.

The agency now believes up to 1.2 million childcare workers could be affected.

In one of the biggest law enforcement operations ever aimed at the dark web, officials from ten countries have arrested 270 customers and sellers who were doing well on dark web marketplaces. Operation RapTor was a huge police operation that brought together police teams from Asia, South America, the United States, and Europe. Europol was in charge of it."

The money had been sent through anonymous accounts for years. They also found more than two tons of illegal drugs, a mountain of drugs that included dangerous street killers and party drugs. Authorities also found more than 180 guns, many of which were linked to organized crime groups that used the dark web as a secret catalog to smuggle weapons across international borders. Not to mention the tons of fake goods and illegal digital goods that were found along the way. Anyone who has seen how illegal online markets have grown knows that a takedown like this has an effect on the whole ecosystem, not just the business."

The operation was the result of months, maybe even years, of careful intelligence gathering. It wasn't just any raid. Many of the people who have been arrested have made thousands of illegal sales on different networks. Investigators were able to find real addresses for their accounts, transaction logs, and even private conversations."

Cryptocurrency monitoring teams followed the money around blockchain ledgers like bloodhounds on a scent. Raids happened almost at the same time across time zones, and intelligence was shared in real time through secure databases. Forensic experts from different agencies got together (at least online) to look at computers and encrypted drives that had been taken. This wasn't just one country bragging; it was a real global network showing that working together is always better than being alone when it comes to fighting cyber-enabled crime."

Investigators were still able to follow the money moving between wallets even after trying to mix them up several times. This was possible because of advanced blockchain analysis tools. Machine learning helped find patterns in how vendors acted in different markets. These were small signs, like how they shipped things or how they posted things, that slowly revealed who they were. Undercover agents are said to have set up shop in vendor groups and earned their trust in order to get the proof they needed to make arrests. Digital forensics investigators were able to get data back from devices that criminals thought had been wiped clean. All of this led to the simple but important conclusion that privacy coins and Tor browsers don't always keep people anonymous, especially when there are security holes or human error."

People who have been around for a while become more and more suspicious, newcomers are scared off, and everyone in the community starts to doubt every deal. The psychological effects may last the longest. People used to think that the dark web was invincible, but now that rumors are going around that even the most careful operators were caught because of data from markets that had closed months ago, that feeling is fading."

Do you remember when Hansa and AlphaBay went down in 2017? They were replaced in just a few weeks. The same thing happened with later takedowns. Criminals adapt by becoming more careful and learning from their mistakes. Some people are already moving away from centralized marketplaces and toward peer-to-peer transactions or decentralized platforms. Analysts say that while Operation RapTor will likely cause a temporary drop in the availability of some drugs and weapons, the supply lines are too well-established to disappear completely. The real victory may be the treasure trove of intelligence that investigators now have. This information will keep giving them new leads for months or even years to come."

          "text": "But there is no doubt that something big is happening. Even though anonymity on the dark web was never completely guaranteed, a lot of criminals were willing to take the risk for a long time. Because of better forensic methods, easier sharing of data across borders, and better tracking of crypto movements, the math has changed. According to the head of Europol's European Cybercrime Centre, law enforcement can now access the dark web. People used to feel safe buying and selling things in forums and chat rooms, but now they are full of that message. People who have never been to the dark web might think all of this is crazy. But the effects are big. The drugs that are sold on these websites don't stay on the internet; they end up on city streets all over the world, where they cause overdoses and put a strain on public health systems. Violent groups use the weapons, which have an effect on whole populations. Even the hacked data and fake items put people's safety and real economies at risk. We are reminded by projects like RapTor that every anonymous transaction has real consequences. Investigators expect to make more arrests in the future as they look more closely at the data they took. The operation has already found other networks that weren't affected in the first wave. Instead of just destroying one market at a time, future strategies will probably focus even more on getting into the supply chain early and mapping out the ecosystem. The lesson for criminals who read this—and some do—is clear: things have changed. What used to be a safe online playground has turned into a high-stakes battleground where law enforcement agencies around the world are getting better at using technology and getting organized every year. In the end, Operation RapTor is more than just another news story about drugs and guns. It shows how international policing is changing to keep up with the fact that crime happens across borders these days. The dark web and the people who use it for illegal things will not go away. But the false belief that safety is perfect? That just got hit hard. The message becomes clearer as investigators do their jobs and new resources become available online: there is no part of the internet that is truly off-limits anymore. For those who built their empires on being anonymous, the walls are closing in faster than anyone could have thought."

In Northern Ireland you can contact the PSNI directly or use the usual non-emergency channels.

The three men in Northern Ireland are innocent until proven guilty, of course. Their devices are still being examined, and no charges have been brought yet. But the fact that police could identify them at all shows how much progress has been made since the early days of dark-web child abuse sites. Back then, many offenders genuinely believed they were untouchable. Today that confidence is cracking."

Along with the 400 FBI and 300 DEA agents who were moved because of emergency orders related to border surges, this is what happened. These people have been building cases against drug lords who flood the streets with opiates or human traffickers who take advantage of kids for decades.

It uses data from FOIA requests and stories from whistleblowers to show that HSI has handled 28% fewer child exploitation cases in the last 18 months. During an interview with our staff, Ming said, \"It's not about being anti-immigration.\" \"The most important thing is balance. Taking professionals out of these sensitive investigations not only delays justice, but it also gives criminals more time to change and avoid getting caught.

Lawmakers point to some cases where transferred agents left holes: A group of local police in the Midwest, who don't have the same computer forensics tools as the federal government, were told to look into a ring that uses social media apps to force teens to do things. A retired HSI agent told us, \"These cases don't solve themselves,\" because they were worried about being criticized. \"Continuity is important; you need to know the players and how they usually act.
