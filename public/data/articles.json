On a flight to Florida recently, Trump spun this tale aboard Air Force One, saying the project got sidelined by the war and nearly revived in 1902, but never came to fruition. 'For 200 years they’ve wanted to build an arch,' he said, noting that 57 other cities around the world have them, but D.C. is missing out.

Historians like Chandra Manning from Georgetown University point out that early Washington was more concerned with basics—like finishing the Capitol or building roads that actually went somewhere—than fancy monuments.

It'd sit near the Arlington Memorial Bridge over the Potomac, evoking Paris's Arc de Triomphe, which honors French revolutionaries and Napoleonic soldiers. But Paris's version is only about 164 feet high; Trump's would dwarf it. He's setting up a committee to oversee it, though details on cost, funding, or approvals are fuzzy.

Space has always been tight at the White House, but there's no historical outcry for a ballroom. He's also shutting down the Kennedy Center for two years of renovations, sparking artist backlash.
