Some steel jobs were temporarily boosted, but farmers needed billions of dollars in bailouts, and the economy as a whole took a small step back. Because the global economy is still recovering from the pandemic and supply chain scars, this time seems bigger. Even though there was a lot of talk about a renaissance, government data shows that manufacturing jobs actually fell by more than 100,000 last year. That makes the story a little less believable for skeptics."

The opposition had to choose former diplomat Edmundo González after they disqualified her on a weak technicality. After that, terrible things happened, like arrests, the end of protests, harassment of candidates, and reliable reports of widespread human rights violations. Things went wrong when the government-run election council declared Maduro the winner, even though there was a lot of proof that he had cheated. For example, opposition-leaked vote totals showed that González won by a landslide. He had to run away to Spain because an arrest warrant was issued for him."

For the Trump administration, it’s another data point in a campaign they say is saving American lives.

What is clear is that the operation will continue until the White House decides otherwise, and for now that decision appears nowhere in sight."

      "text": "When the White House dropped its long-awaited National Security Strategy late last year, plenty of us in the foreign-policy world cleared our calendars. Here was supposed to be the Trump administration’s big-picture blueprint for keeping America safe and strong in a messy world. Instead, after reading the document, a lot of seasoned diplomats and analysts came away shaking their heads. What they got felt less like a serious roadmap and more like a partisan manifesto wrapped in the language of national security—one that spends as much time fighting domestic culture battles as it does thinking about China, Russia, or the next flashpoint in the Middle East."

      "text": "The document opens with a mini-lecture on what “strategy” actually means: a clear link between ends and means, priorities, trade-offs, the whole nine yards. Fair enough. But then it immediately breaks its own rules. Rather than laying out how America will actually use its military, money, and alliances to get things done, the NSS reads like a long list of grievances mixed with feel-good slogans. It talks about “reasserting sovereignty,” “restoring American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere,” and stopping “mass migration” at the border—framing all of it as a modern update to the old Monroe Doctrine. That’s the famous “Trump Corollary” everyone’s now whispering about, though the paper never quite explains how it works in practice."

Sounds great. But nowhere does the strategy connect those goals to real budgets, troop numbers, diplomatic initiatives, or the tough choices that every real strategy demands. There’s no honest discussion about how cracking down on immigration or restricting foreign students at top universities might actually hurt America’s edge in those very technologies it wants to lead. It’s like the authors listed everything they don’t like and called it a plan."

One put it bluntly: “A real strategy forces you to say what you won’t do. This one avoids every hard trade-off.” Another, a veteran from the State Department, told me over coffee last week, “It’s a laundry list of complaints dressed up as grand strategy. There’s no theory of victory—just vibes and slogans.”"

The NSS preaches respect for sovereignty, then turns around and openly lectures European governments about their own political choices, migration policies, and even their “civilizational self-confidence.” It warns about the “fearsome powers” of federal agencies while glossing over controversies inside the administration itself. It claims to want closer ties with India, yet the document ignores—or quietly undermines—years of careful bipartisan work that built those very ties. And it keeps repeating the line about “foreign policy for the middle class,” blaming past leaders for forgetting ordinary Americans. Fair critique in parts, but it never explains how pulling back from global leadership is supposed to raise wages in Ohio or bring factories back home."

It says the United States should only worry about foreign problems that “directly threaten U.S. interests.” Sounds tough and realistic—until you think about it. If Washington signals it will only show up when its own backyard is on fire, why should anyone else keep buying American weapons, using the dollar, or joining U.S.-led coalitions? Alliances have never been charity. They’re deals based on mutual benefit. When you rewrite the deal to “America First and only America First,” you risk allies deciding they’re better off hedging their bets with China or going solo."

Globalization isn’t stopping; it’s just rerouting around the United States. Instead of shaping the rules, America risks watching from the sidelines while others write them."

Russia’s war in Ukraine gets a quick nod but nowhere near the attention you’d expect for Europe’s biggest security crisis since World War II. The broader threat of rising authoritarianism is downplayed. The ideological challenge from Beijing and Moscow is treated more as an economic nuisance than a systemic rivalry. Meanwhile, the sharpest language is reserved for democratic allies who don’t line up perfectly with the administration’s worldview."

It rests on the quiet, daily cooperation of friends and partners who trust us: sharing intelligence, opening markets, supporting sanctions, joining coalitions. When you treat allies like free riders who need constant scolding, that trust erodes fast."

In the middle of June 2025, Israel launched a huge 12-day attack on Iranian missile sites, air defenses, and high-ranking military leaders. The US took decisive action with Operation Midnight Hammer, launching Tomahawk missiles and dropping bunker-buster bombs on the heavily guarded nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. The attacks destroyed radar networks, buried enrichment rooms deep underground, and killed important IRGC leaders.

This alert came from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the National Security Agency, and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, who released a detailed advisory together. Brickstorm is a custom-built backdoor that lets attackers slip past defenses, grab sensitive information like passwords and configuration files, and stay hidden inside networks for months at a time. In one confirmed case, the intruders got into a company’s systems back in April 2024 and remained active until September 3, 2025, even though the organization had standard cybersecurity protections in place."

VMware vSphere is one of the most widely used virtualization platforms for managing virtual machines and cloud infrastructure in government, corporate, and defense settings. Once the hackers reach a vCenter server or ESXi host, they can drop Brickstorm, which is often written in Go to make it harder to detect on appliances that don’t run full endpoint protection. The malware changes its own code signature to dodge antivirus scans, uses encrypted channels to talk to its command servers, abuses normal system tools so it doesn’t look suspicious, dumps credentials, and moves sideways across the network. It can even copy itself into startup locations or tweak VMware startup scripts to stay persistent."

Forensic experts from different agencies got together (at least online) to look at computers and encrypted drives that had been taken.

Undercover agents are said to have set up shop in vendor groups and earned their trust in order to get the proof they needed to make arrests. Digital forensics investigators were able to get data back from devices that criminals thought had been wiped clean. All of this led to the simple but important conclusion that privacy coins and Tor browsers don't always keep people anonymous, especially when there are security holes or human error."

People who have been around for a while become more and more suspicious, newcomers are scared off, and everyone in the community starts to doubt every deal. The psychological effects may last the longest. People used to think that the dark web was invincible, but now that rumors are going around that even the most careful operators were caught because of data from markets that had closed months ago, that feeling is fading."

Do you remember when Hansa and AlphaBay went down in 2017? They were replaced in just a few weeks. The same thing happened with later takedowns. Criminals adapt by becoming more careful and learning from their mistakes. Some people are already moving away from centralized marketplaces and toward peer-to-peer transactions or decentralized platforms. Analysts say that while Operation RapTor will likely cause a temporary drop in the availability of some drugs and weapons, the supply lines are too well-established to disappear completely. The real victory may be the treasure trove of intelligence that investigators now have. This information will keep giving them new leads for months or even years to come."

Even though anonymity on the dark web was never completely guaranteed, a lot of criminals were willing to take the risk for a long time. Because of better forensic methods, easier sharing of data across borders, and better tracking of crypto movements, the math has changed. According to the head of Europol's European Cybercrime Centre, law enforcement can now access the dark web. People used to feel safe buying and selling things in forums and chat rooms, but now they are full of that message. People who have never been to the dark web might think all of this is crazy. But the effects are big. The drugs that are sold on these websites don't stay on the internet; they end up on city streets all over the world, where they cause overdoses and put a strain on public health systems. Violent groups use the weapons, which have an effect on whole populations. Even the hacked data and fake items put people's safety and real economies at risk. We are reminded by projects like RapTor that every anonymous transaction has real consequences. Investigators expect to make more arrests in the future as they look more closely at the data they took. The operation has already found other networks that weren't affected in the first wave. Instead of just destroying one market at a time, future strategies will probably focus even more on getting into the supply chain early and mapping out the ecosystem. The lesson for criminals who read this—and some do—is clear: things have changed. What used to be a safe online playground has turned into a high-stakes battleground where law enforcement agencies around the world are getting better at using technology and getting organized every year. In the end, Operation RapTor is more than just another news story about drugs and guns. It shows how international policing is changing to keep up with the fact that crime happens across borders these days. The dark web and the people who use it for illegal things will not go away. But the false belief that safety is perfect? That just got hit hard. The message becomes clearer as investigators do their jobs and new resources become available online: there is no part of the internet that is truly off-limits anymore. For those who built their empires on being anonymous, the walls are closing in faster than anyone could have thought."
