Some steel jobs were temporarily boosted, but farmers needed billions of dollars in bailouts, and the economy as a whole took a small step back. Because the global economy is still recovering from the pandemic and supply chain scars, this time seems bigger. Even though there was a lot of talk about a renaissance, government data shows that manufacturing jobs actually fell by more than 100,000 last year. That makes the story a little less believable for skeptics."

The opposition had to choose former diplomat Edmundo González after they disqualified her on a weak technicality. After that, terrible things happened, like arrests, the end of protests, harassment of candidates, and reliable reports of widespread human rights violations. Things went wrong when the government-run election council declared Maduro the winner, even though there was a lot of proof that he had cheated. For example, opposition-leaked vote totals showed that González won by a landslide. He had to run away to Spain because an arrest warrant was issued for him."

For the Trump administration, it’s another data point in a campaign they say is saving American lives. For critics, it’s another example of lethal force being used with too little accountability in a part of the world where the United States has long wielded overwhelming power."

What is clear is that the operation will continue until the White House decides otherwise, and for now that decision appears nowhere in sight."

He says the capital has been dreaming of something like this for two centuries, even starting work on it with four eagle statues before the Civil War threw everything off track. On a flight to Florida recently, Trump spun this tale aboard Air Force One, saying the project got sidelined by the war and nearly revived in 1902, but never came to fruition. 'For 200 years they’ve wanted to build an arch,' he said, noting that 57 other cities around the world have them, but D.C. is missing out. He wants his version to be the biggest, maybe 250 feet tall, topped with Lady Liberty, and unveiled for America's 250th birthday bash."

And while D.C. has toyed with arches here and there, there's no evidence of a 200-year clamor for one. Historians like Chandra Manning from Georgetown University point out that early Washington was more concerned with basics—like finishing the Capitol or building roads that actually went somewhere—than fancy monuments. 'Washington coming into the Civil War was still this unfinished city,' she says. No one's records show a big push for an arch back then."

The biggest one caught his eye, and reports suggest he's eyeing a 250-foot behemoth—taller than the White House or Lincoln Memorial, almost rivaling the Capitol's 288 feet. It'd sit near the Arlington Memorial Bridge over the Potomac, evoking Paris's Arc de Triomphe, which honors French revolutionaries and Napoleonic soldiers. But Paris's version is only about 164 feet high; Trump's would dwarf it. He's setting up a committee to oversee it, though details on cost, funding, or approvals are fuzzy. Harrison Design, a local firm, is on board, but no groundbreaking date yet."

Space has always been tight at the White House, but there's no historical outcry for a ballroom. He's also shutting down the Kennedy Center for two years of renovations, sparking artist backlash. The Rose Garden got a patio redo reminiscent of his Mar-a-Lago resort. Inside, he added a presidential portrait Walk of Fame, massive flagpoles, and gold accents across multiple rooms."
